	      <H1>
		Welcome to the CSUN Sandbox Environment.
	      </H1>

	      <p>
		The CSUN Sandox Environment provides students, faculty, and units with a flexible
		environment to deliver, to deploy, to develop, to pilot, to prototype, or to just play
		with new technology.  This technlogy could be used to support your class curriculum, to
		support your research, to engage students in exploratory activities, or other activities
		in which are you interested.
	      </p>

	      <p>
		This environment is maintained and supported by the our students in the CIT (Computer
		Information Technology) and Computer Science programs, under the supervision and
		mentorship of the META+LAB and the Advanced Technology Lab.  Although this is not a
		production environment and we can NOT provide a guarenteed level of service, we provide
		best effort support with the goal of providing exceptional support.
	      </p>

	      <p>
		To get a better understanding of the possibilities and to learn how others are using the
		sandbox environment, feel free to peruse the list of projects and activities being
		supported.  For more information, please send us an email at <a href="mailto:info@sandbox.csun.edu">info@sandbox.csun.edu</a>.
