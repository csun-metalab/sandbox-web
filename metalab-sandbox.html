		Welcome to the META+LAB Sandbox Environment.
	      </H1>

	      <p>
		The Lab is a student-run, staff-and-faculty supported organization directed to the development of mobile-responsive web applications for the University and for external clients. Under the mentorship of faculty, students who gain admission to the program work on these applications, as well as on creative design solutions and marketing strategies within an interdisciplinary setting. A fundamental purpose of META+LAB is to hone students' professional skills and extend their curriculum through real case projects, collaboration, and team-based interaction in order to prepare them to work in our dynamic and diverse workforce.
		  </p>
